This is a WIP fuzzer for move smart contracts. It is built using [LibAFL](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/libafl)

## Contributing

The fuzzer itself is at very early stage. Feel free to grab an issue and start working on it.

Make sure you ran `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` before submitting a PR.

AI generated code is allowed but please review it first. e.g. delete chatty comments. Make sure to manage your agent well and shitty code won't be reviewed.
