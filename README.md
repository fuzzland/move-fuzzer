# move-fuzzer

A unified fuzzing framework for Move-based blockchains. Detects shift violations and other security issues in Move smart contracts through automated fuzzing.

## Features

- **Multi-blockchain support**: Unified framework supporting multiple Move-based blockchains
- **Violation detection**: Real-time detection of arithmetic shift violations and other security issues
- **Intelligent mutation**: Multiple mutation strategies for comprehensive testing coverage
- **State management**: Sophisticated object caching for stateful contract testing
- **Automated testing**: Complete integration test framework

## Quick Start

### Automated Integration Testing

```bash
# Setup venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt

# Run tests
python scripts/integration_test.py
```

The script will automatically:

1. Build move-fuzzer (cargo build --release)
2. Start a fresh localnet
3. Setup wallet and request tokens from faucet
4. Deploy the shl_demo contract
5. Create necessary test objects (shared structs)
6. Run all fuzzing test cases with 10,000 iterations each
7. Exit with code 0 if all tests pass, 1 if any fail
